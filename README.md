# Web-Scraper

Okay so hear me out

I wanted to learn to use Puppeteer.

I also want a list of items currently in Minecraft, segregated into categories.

I found a website that has this info, but there wasn't any way to export it.

Sooooo... Now this exists.

I'm not sharing the exported data itself, but you can just run `npm install` and `npm run start` to get the output.
